# Logistics-Dashboard-Debugging-and-Optimization-with-Power-BI

In this unique mini-project, we approach Power BI from a troubleshooting perspective. You are provided with a dashboard filled with errors and inconsistencies, and your task is to deconstruct it and deliver a professional analysis, using the skills developed throughout the course.

The business scenario involves a logistics company that requested a dashboard to understand the efficiency of its product delivery process. However, the initial dashboard, developed by someone with limited Power BI knowledge, contains several errors. Your role is to identify, justify, and correct these issues to present an optimized version of the dashboard.

The dashboard should display the following KPIs:

Total On-Time Deliveries by Delivery Channel
Percentage of Early Deliveries by Delivery Team
Total Deliveries by Month
Total Deliveries by Top 5 Salespersons
Total Late Deliveries by City
Percentage of Deliveries by Delivery Status
The final goal is to provide company directors with accurate insights into their logistics operations, allowing them to make informed decisions based on reliable data.
